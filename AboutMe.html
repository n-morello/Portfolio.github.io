          <h2>I'm Nico...</h2>
          <p>
         I am a Graphic Design and Animation student at Seton Hill University, graduating in the Spring of 2026. Throughout my time at college, I have gained experience in concept art as an intern at Castix Studio and various coursework, as well as skills in storyboarding, 2D animation, illustration, graphic and web design, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Adobe Creative Suite. Aside from this, I am also conversant in Spanish. I love visual storytelling, both as an artist and designer and hope to pursue a career that will let me take part in it. Besides the specific coursework and experience I have gained from my time at Seton Hill, I believe my Liberal Arts education gives a special advantage as a professional. Not only do I know my field, but I am faamiliar with the other positions that may be important at the companies I will work for in the future. This allows me to better work with those other people and ultimately allows for better efficiency in whatever we may be producing. I also have become a more well rounded person from my Liberal Arts education, learning how to better critically think in all disciplines. Being nearly done with my college career, I'm excited to get into the profesisonal world!
